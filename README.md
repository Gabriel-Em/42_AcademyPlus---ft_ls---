# 42 Academy+Plus - ft_ls

A 42 (school) project that required us to recode the well known Unix command ls.

For more details regarding the project see 'ft_ls - Subject(EN).pdf'

## How to use

Using a terminal from within the ft_ls directory:
- run the command `make` (this generates the binary as **"ft_ls"**)
- run ft_ls as `./ft_ls *flags* *files and folders*` as you would run the real ls

## Features:
- the check for ACL's and extended attributes is implemented - `@` and `+` are displayed at the end of file permissions column if required]
- special file permissions are also implemented [`sStT`]
- ft_ls checks if the output is a terminal and displays stats accordingly, using the right format as real ls does
- correct display of minor, major or filesize depending on file's type
- flags that can be used with ft_ls: **`-1AGSRaglort`** *(See the manual for the real ls for more details)*
- all features necessary for the accurate display of stats with the right format using any of the flags that ft_ls is able to use are implemented
